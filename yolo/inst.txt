Paste the 'yolo' folder in 'src' folder of your workspace

navigate to yolo workspace in terminal and execute following commands

"""
	cd easy-yolov7
	pip3 install Cython==0.29.32
	pip3 install -r requirements.txt
"""

This will take around 10 min to complete.

Install dependencies, run following in the same terminal

"""
	sudo apt install ros-humble-navigation2
	sudo apt install ros-humble-nav2-bringup
"""

Modify the launch file in location 'yolo/launch/navigation.launch.py'
with the location of package in your system, 
"""
	map_path = '/home/jagadeesh/detect/src/yolo/params/final.yaml'
        nav_path = '/home/jagadeesh/detect/src/yolo/params/nav2_params.yaml'
        slam_param_path = '/home/jagadeesh/detect/src/yolo/params/mapper_params_online_async.yaml'
"""

after completetion execute following to build the workspace (in the same terminal)

"""
	cd ../../../
	colcon build
	source install/setup.bash
"""

To run the program with nav2 and yolov7 

Termnal-1:
"""
	ros2 launch beach_world world.launch.py
"""

Terminal-2:
"""
	ros2 launch rosbot_xl_gazebo spawn.launch.py use_sim_time:=True camera_model:=orbbec_astra
"""

Terminal-3:
"""
	ros2 launch yolo navigation.launch.py
"""

This will open yolov7 detecion window + rviz with navigation stack enabled

At first initialize robot with "initial pose" in rviz.
